3. O resultado foi: "All right, diving right in. Looks like you're fascinated with AI, huh? All that hyper realistic stuff, so real you can't tell if it's human or, well, you know, AI, like those natty or not bodybuilding things. Is it natural or not? Exactly. We've got a whole pile of your sources here, articles, YouTube transcripts, even guidelines for some challenges. But one that's really got me curious is this Vinylton guy from Dio Digital Innovation one. Yeah. What about him? He's asking if he's himself natty or some kind of. Super convincing AI, that's a clever hook gotta give him that gets right to the heart of it. Can AI really fool us? Right. And he's not just talking, he actually wants us to try it. Oh, like a challenge. Exactly. Create something realistic with AI. Text, audio, video, whatever. And get this. Dio even put a template on GitHub to help us out. And here's the best part, Share it on social media with the hashtag #lapidaddy or not, I'm sensing a theme here. But it does make you think about the potential, you know? Beyond just fun and games? Oh absolutely. Larissa Thalia. In her YouTube video, she's all about AI revolutionizing everything. Imagine doctors diagnosing diseases super early, saving lives or all that boring stuff we have to do. AI could handle it, freeing us up for like way more interesting work. And who knows what new jobs AI will create. But I bet some listeners are hearing this and thinking, hold on, what about the downsides? Job losses? Privacy. AI going all you know. Rogue those are legit worries for sure that's where the dialectics YouTube video is great cuts through the hype explains it all so anyone can understand even if you're like totally overwhelmed by AI, which is easy to be honestly with all the headlines is hype or fear exactly so dial Linux tackles the big questions what is intelligence even for humans for machines different types of AI, how they learn and that big one yeah what about our jobs is AI going to put us all out of work right but connecting back to natty or not Dailoni's. Big on critical thinking about this stuff. Can't just assume something's human because it looks or sounds good. That would be more discerning. Like training our ears in this case. Exactly. Which is why understanding how AI works is crucial. They use this analogy, teaching a kid about cats. You show pictures, point out features, correct them when they're wrong. Eventually they get good at spotting cats. AI is the same. Learning from mistakes. So it's not thinking like we do. Like they have that maze example. The network learns to get out but doesn't actually understand the maze. Right. Yeah, it's following. And calculations, not having a conscious plan. And that brings us to these large language models, LLMS like ChatGPT. Amazing, trained on tons of data, but still basically statistical machines. OK, so predicting the next word, kind of like our phone keyboards, guessing what we'll type. It's all about probability. Not real smart exactly. And they use these things called tokens representing words as numbers like cat is 123, dog is 456, whatever. That's how they get grammar and. Fascinating. It is. But here's the thing, more tokens don't automatically equal a smarter AI. It's about the data quality and how it's trained. You know, like a chef, right? Best ingredients in the world. But if they don't know how to cook exactly. And that's how AI makes such convincing stuff. These models have been fed so much data. They nail human language, like perfectly grammar, style, even tone. So they're kind of absorbing the fingerprint of human language and using that to create. You got it. But that's also why we got to be careful. Just because it sounds human doesn't mean it is like an echo of creativity without the real understanding behind it. Which is where that hallucination thing comes in, right? Dialectics mentioned it. The AI just spouting nonsense. Still under development. Not perfect. Remember all those calculations? Sometimes they go off the rails and the output is just weird. I've seen some of those online. Hilarious, but kind of creepy too. But if even experts get fooled, what hope do we regular folks have? It's not about. There, it's awareness. The more we get how these models work, the better we spot the fakes. And this goes beyond like fake news or whatever. It's about a is impact on everything, especially jobs. Yeah, that's the big worry for a lot of people. AI doing all the boring tasks, freeing us up. But then what? No jobs left for us. Gaia Linux compares it to other tech revolutions like driving back in the 30s, manual transmissions, that was skill. Now it's all automatic, easier for everyone. Job changed, didn't disappear. Like computers in the 80s, you needed to be a tech whiz just to turn 1 on. Now my toddler is swiping through as skills change. But we still need humans involved. Exactly. And just like those shifts, AI will likely change jobs, not erase them. It's about adapting, learning new skills that work with AI. So let's robot take over. More like leveling up alongside the tech. Precisely. AI handling the repetitive stuff so we can focus on what makes us human. Strategy, problem solving, creativity, all that good stuff. Way more optimistic. And like Larissa Thalia said, AI might even create new jobs, especially in tech. It's not US versus AI, it's a partnership. Remember, AI isn't just robots. It's using data to solve big problems, make smarter choices. Dialectics talked about using it for environmental stuff. That's huge for everyone. So shifting our view, not a threat, but a powerful tool like the Internet. It depends how we use it. Exactly. And Speaking of everyday use, you're already using AI tons, probably without even noticing, though. Totally. Our phones are packed. Portrait mode on cameras, night shots, object recognition and don't forget voice assistance. We use those for everything. AI is all around us and Dia Linux encourages us to explore it more. They mention hugging face and stable diffusion. Those platforms let you try AI hands on experience. I love that become AI explorers, not just watching from the sidelines, but diving in and getting involved, which is exactly the spirit of natty or not. Play, create, push the limits and along the way we learn more about. This amazing tech, I'm really excited to see what our listener creates for this challenge, natty or not, that we'll see some mind blowing AI stuff, the kind that makes you question like, what even is human creativity anymore? It'll be fascinating. And it's not just about tech skills, right? It's sparking this whole conversation. What does creativity mean in the AI age? If AI can make art, music, write stories and we can't tell the difference, what happens to originality, to artistic expression? Whoa, yeah. Like we're entering this new. Humans and AI creating together. What if AI could boost our creativity, help us explore ideas we never would have thought of on our own? An AI brainstorming buddy blasting through those creative blocks that changes everything. But then what about the value we put on human creativity? If AI can whip up a masterpiece in seconds, will we still care about the time, the effort, the passion that human artists pour in? It's a good question. It's like handmade versus machine made. You know, a machine can make a perfect copy, but we often appreciate. The little flaws, the uniqueness of something made by hand. Exactly. There's something special about knowing a human poured their heart into it. Maybe those imperfections are what make human art so powerful. The little mistakes, the unexpected turns, the raw emotion, those connect us to the artist, to their soul. And that's what AI can't do. Not really. Mimic, imitate, sure, but it can't capture the human experience. Interesting thought. Human creativity might always hold a special place, even if. Is everywhere. Maybe AI becomes just another tool for the artist, helping them express themselves in new ways. O as we wrap U, I'm left wondering if AI content gets so good we can't tell it apart. Do we need new ways to value human creativity? Or will AI just become a way to make our own creativity even better? That's going to keep challenging us as AI becomes more and more part of our lives. And who knows, the answer might be a bit of both. Well, that's all the time we have for this deep dive. Hope you enjoyed exploring AI with us and all the ways it's blurring the lines between human and artificial. Don't forget to share your Natty or not creations until next time. Keep exploring and keep diving deep." 
4. Como podemos ver, foi um podcast de 8 minutos e que foi perfeitamente convertido em texto com a ajuda do Speech Studio do Azure.
5. Depois, usei a análise de sentimento nas frases seguintes:
6.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a43cc7dc-7a58-4922-bbcf-3d0879c1ad49)
7. Inicialmente, apenas consegui a primeira frase analisada. Tentei separar por vírgulas e nada. Só quando adicionei pontos ao final de cada frase o sistema reconheceu várias sentenças:

12. Percebe-se que nas frases em que há uma comparação ele marcou como neutro, e foi muito interessante quando dito que "o outro programa é muito melhor" ele marcou majoritariamente positivo, mas com neutro (da comparação) e negativo.
